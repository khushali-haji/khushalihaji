      <strong>Hello.</strong> I’m Khushali, a multimedia journalist, filmmaker, and researcher interested in how people experience systems, cities, and power, and how storytelling can bring data to life.
    </p>

    <p class="intro">
 When I trained as an urban designer in India at CEPT University, learning how cities are planned on paper, I kept noticing what didn’t fit on the page: the messiness of daily life, the politics that operated at different scales, and the emotions and aspirations that make a city what it is. Looking for ways to explore that gap, I turned to theatre and essay writing. Writing speculative fiction, character-driven stories, and research essays allowed me to ask questions that centered the people who lived in these cities – how do different genders, castes, and classes experience them? Who is the city really for and who gets left out? How?    </p>

    <p class="intro">
Storytelling eventually pulled me beyond design and into journalism and filmmaking, mediums that let me research deeply and speak to audiences beyond academic circles. Studying International Reporting and Documentary Filmmaking at the Newmark Graduate School of Journalism (CUNY), I learned to follow stories in the space between policy, data, and lived reality, and to use different media to tell them. Since then, I’ve reported on asylum policies, carbon credit markets, domestic violence, and interfaith luncheons, and made short films about connection, ambition, and belonging. My reporting has been recognized with the Dennis Duggan Award from the Silurians Press Club, and my short documentary received a Special Jury Mention at the 2025 Woodstock Film Festival.    </p>

    <p class="intro">
My work has taken me from investigative reporting on carbon credit markets in Liberia to community engagement on a crowd management project in Varanasi. Now based in New York, I work as a journalist and video editor across formats and beats — from public health and collective mourning to fashion editorials — always drawn to stories where systems meet lived experience.    </p>

     <p class="intro">
You can explore my journalism under <strong>Reporting</strong>, urban design work under <strong>Urban / Design</strong>, video projects under <strong>Videos</strong>, and essays under <strong>Writing</strong>.

<p class="intro">
I’m always interested in collaborating with people and teams who want to tell the human side of complex stories, be it through journalism, filmmaking, public health and urban research, or other forms of data-informed storytelling.
